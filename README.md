# 🏥 V.A.I.D. (Virtual AI Doctor)

> **Intelligent Health Analysis with Vision & Voice**
> *A Multilingual AI Doctor powered by Llama 4, Whisper, and ElevenLabs.*



## 📖 Overview

**V.A.I.D.** (Virtual AI Doctor) is an advanced telemedicine prototype designed to bridge the gap between patients and medical advice using multimodal AI. It simulates a real doctor-patient interaction by "seeing" symptoms, "hearing" concerns in multiple languages, and "speaking" back with professional advice.

### Key Capabilities:
1.  **👁️ Vision:** Diagnoses medical issues from uploaded images using the **Llama 4 Multimodal** model.
2.  **🗣️ Voice:** Listens to patients in **Hindi, English, Spanish, etc.** using **Whisper v3**.
3.  **🔊 Speech:** Responds with a human-like voice using **ElevenLabs Multilingual v2**.
4.  **💬 Text Support:** Includes a fallback text chat for users who prefer typing.
